# Pokecatalogue

Pokemon catalog project, made with: ReactJS, in this project I practice both class components and function components with hooks; I also practice with axios and react-paginate as well; the look is done with Bootstrap4 and Sass.

This fornt-end app consumes its information from the api https://pokeapi.co/ In addition to that, I also work with Docker and GitHub Actions for a CI/CD workflow.
